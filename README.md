# Mood visualization
I made this little script to help me with visualization of my mood.
To monitor my well-being I use [Daylio](https://daylio.net/)  app which has an option to export the data to csv.

## Usage
- Clone this repo
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download your exported data from [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) (or your own data, but you would need to format it in the same way as [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) does)
- put path to your file into `data_file_path`
- Run `main.py`
- Enjoy!

### Dependencies
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Calmap](https://pypi.org/project/calmap/)
